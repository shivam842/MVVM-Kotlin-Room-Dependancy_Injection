/*
Companion object => in Kotlin. Unlike Java or C#, Kotlin doesn't have static members or member functions.
            If you need to write a function that can be called without having a class instance but needs access to the internals of a class,
            you can write it as a member of a companion object declaration inside that class.

suspend => [suspend fun userLogin()] this functions are the  center of the everything in the coroutine.
            suspending function is a function that can be paused and resumed at related file.
            This type of function can execute a long running operation and wait for it with dought blocking

Unit    => is same as main in java

object  => is same as static in java
